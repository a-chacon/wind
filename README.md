## Installation: The Easy Way to Have Your Site on GitHub Pages (Recommended!) 😄

1. **Navigate to the Main Page of the Repository**

   On GitHub.com, go to the main page of the repository at [wind-theme](https://github.com/a-chacon/wind).

2. **Click 'Use this Template'**

   Click the "Use this template" button above the file list and select "Create a new repository."

3. **Set Repository Details**

   - Select the owner of the repository.
   - Type a name for your repository. If you want the site to be available at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`, name it `YOURUSERNAME.github.io` (replace `YOURUSERNAME` with your GitHub username). Otherwise, you can choose any name you prefer, and the site will be available at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORYNAME`.
   - Add an optional description.
   - Choose repository visibility.

4. **Create Repository from Template**

   Click "Create repository from template."

5. **Enable GitHub Pages**

   To deploy the site on GitHub Pages, enable it in your repository settings. Go to **Settings -> Pages -> Source** and select `GitHub Actions`.

6. **Customize Your Website Settings**

   Edit the `_config.yml` file to change any settings you want. The settings in the file are self-explanatory, and there are comments inside to help you understand what each setting does. After making changes, click the "Commit changes" button to save them.

7. **Congratulations! You Have a Website!**

   If you named the repository `YOURUSERNAME.github.io`, your website should be ready in a minute or two at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io`. If you used a different name, your website will be available at `https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORYNAME`. Every time you make a change to any file, your website will be rebuilt and updated in about a minute.

## Advanced Installation (Optional) ⚙

1. **Create a New Jekyll Site**

   If you don’t already have a Jekyll site, create one with:

   ```bash
    jekyll new my-site
   ```

   Then, navigate into your new site’s directory:

   ```bash
    cd my-site
   ```

2. **Add the Theme to Your Gemfile**

   Open your `Gemfile` and add this line:

   ```ruby
    gem "wind-theme"
   ```

3. **Update Your `_config.yml`**

   In your `_config.yml` file, add this line:

   ```yaml
   theme: wind-theme
   ```

4. **Install the Theme**

   Run the following command to install the theme and its dependencies:

   ```bash
    bundle
   ```

5. **Run Your Site**

   Start your Jekyll site with:

   ```bash
    bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

## Usage

Wind has been scaffolded by the `jekyll new-theme` command and therefore has all the necessary files and directories to have a new Jekyll site up and running with zero-configuration.

### Layouts

Refers to files within the `_layouts` directory, that define the markup for your theme.

- `base.html` &mdash; The base layout that lays the foundation for subsequent layouts. The derived layouts inject their
  contents into this file at the line that says `{{ content }}` and are linked to this file via
  [FrontMatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) declaration `layout: base`.
- `home.html` &mdash; The layout for your landing-page / home-page / index-page. [[More Info.](#home-layout)]
- `page.html` &mdash; The layout for your documents that contain FrontMatter, but are not posts. Example about.md page.
- `post.html` &mdash; The layout for your posts.
- `galley.html` &mdash; The layout for a image galley.

#### Home Layout

`home.html` is a flexible HTML layout for the site's landing-page / home-page / index-page.

##### _Main Heading and Content-injection_

The _home_ layout will inject all content from your `index.md` / `index.html` **before** the **`Posts`** section. This will allow you to include non-posts related content to be published on the landing page under a dedicated heading. _I recommended that you title this section with a Heading2 (`##`)_.

#### Gallery Layout

This Layout needs a data file with the name `_data/gallery.yml` and the following structure:

```
photos:
  - url: path/to/your/photo.png
    description: Alt for the image
    quote: text on hover
```

### Includes

Refers to snippets of code within the `_includes` directory that can be inserted in multiple layouts (and another include-file as well) within the same theme-gem.

- `disqus_comments.html` &mdash; Code to markup disqus comment box.
- `footer.html` &mdash; Defines the site's footer section.
- `head.html` &mdash; Code-block that defines the `<head></head>` in _default_ layout.
- `custom-head.html` &mdash; Placeholder to allow users to add more metadata to `<head />`.
- `header.html` &mdash; Defines the site's main header section. By default, pages with a defined `title` attribute will have links displayed here.
- `navbar.html` &mdash; Defines the site's navbar section. By default, `title` is used in the left section and main pages are displayed in the rigth section.
- `up_button.html` &mdash; Includes the code related to the up button.

## Configuration

The template needs at least `title` and `author` settings in your `_config.yml` for works fine. The title is used in the nabvar section and the author is displayed in the posts.

### Enabling comments (via Disqus)

Optionally, if you have a Disqus account, you can tell Jekyll to use it to show a comments section below each post.

:warning: `url`, e.g. `https://example.com`, must be set in you config file for Disqus to work.

To enable it, after setting the url field, you also need to add the following lines to your Jekyll site:

```yaml
disqus:
  shortname: my_disqus_shortname
```

You can find out more about Disqus' shortnames [here](https://help.disqus.com/installation/whats-a-shortname).

Comments are enabled by default and will only appear in production, i.e., `JEKYLL_ENV=production`

If you don't want to display comments for a particular post you can disable them by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.

## Customization

To override the default structure and style of minima, simply create the concerned directory at the root of your site, copy the file you wish to customize to that directory, and then edit the file.
e.g., to override the [`_includes/head.html`](_includes/head.html) file to specify a custom style path, create an `_includes` directory, copy `_includes/head.html` from minima gem folder to `<yoursite>/_includes` and start editing that file.

### Footer

To customize the text in the footer:

1. Declare your site language in the `_config.yml` file:

    ```yaml
    language: "your_language_code"
    ```

2. Create a language `data` file in the data folder, using your site language code (e.g., `es.yml` for Spanish).

3. Customize the footer variables in the language data file:

        ```yml
        footer:
          title: "Mantengamosnos conectados"
          description: "Puesdes encontrarme en cualquiera de estos canales:"
          pages: "Paginas"
        ```

    Adjust the values of title, description, and pages as needed.

### Plugins

Minima comes with [`jekyll-seo-tag`](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag) plugin preinstalled to make sure your website gets the most useful meta tags. See [usage](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag#usage) to know how to set it up.
